I'm a junior DevOps engineer who is a hard working, energetic, and very curious person, constantly seeking new and fun adventures to expand my knowledge and skills! I've always had a curious mind about how things work, breaking them down to the smallest parts so I can figure out how to stick 'em back together, which was what drew me towards the world of DevOps in the first place. I've been described as a blood-hound when it comes to solving a problem, because I will follow the scent and track it down stubbornly to the ends of the Earth until I solve it! However, I've also got a flair for the ol' razzle dazzle, so it's been a great opportunity to build innovative and exciting new applications with collaboration from other talented and amazing individuals I can learn from.
